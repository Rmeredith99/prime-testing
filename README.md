# prime-testing
This is a prime testing algorithm that runs in time logarithmic to the input number. While the algorithm is technically probabalistic, the chance of being incorrect is smaller than a computer malfunction.

To use this, run the file in the command line where you will be prompted for a number for which the algorithm will determine the primality.
